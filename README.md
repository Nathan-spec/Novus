Tried implementing a bottom navigation bar with three icons that lead to different fragments of the Main Activity file

## Note 
-> Had various fragments here:- 
1) Home Fragment 
2) Profile Fragment 
3) Settings Fragment 

-> These fragments make all the functionalities in the app. 

## Use 
-> Download ZIP file/Clone the code and open the Android Studio. 
-> Run the app.
